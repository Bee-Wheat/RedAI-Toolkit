# 🛡️ AI Red Teamer’s Toolkit

Welcome to the frontline.

This is my personal, no-fluff toolkit for learning and executing red team tactics on large language models (LLMs) and AI systems. It’s part of my mission to go from IT vet to full-blooded AI red team operator — building my own lab, breaking things with intent, and learning what makes modern AI tick (and fail).

## 🎯 Purpose

This repo is designed to:
- Run adversarial tests against local and cloud-based LLMs
- Log vulnerabilities, jailbreaks, and prompt injection results
- Help sharpen my offensive and defensive skills in AI security
- Serve as a working portfolio piece for future roles in AI red teaming and adversarial research

## 🧰 Toolkit Components (in progress)

| Folder           | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| `setup/`         | Notes on installing tools, packages, and dependencies |
| `tools/`         | Individual attack modules (textattack, prompt injection, jailbreak scripts) |
| `logs/`          | Execution logs, results, and notes from tool output |
| `playbooks/`     | Red team exercises, strategies, and test sequences |
| `reports/`       | Human-readable writeups of attacks, findings, and insights |
| `experiments/`   | Scratchpad for things I break, test, or build |

## 🧪 Initial Tools (coming soon)

- [x] Phi-4 Mini running via Ollama
- [ ] Prompt injection test scripts
- [ ] Jailbreak prompt collection
- [ ] LLM security baseline playbook
- [ ] Logging & reporting template

## 🛠️ Status

Still early. Still messy. But moving forward.

## 💡 Future Ideas

- Integrate PyRIT, PromptBench, and OpenPrompt
- Custom logging for repeatable test runs
- OSINT-to-LLM abuse workflows
- Model fingerprinting attempts
- API fuzzing with LLM front ends

## 🧠 Notes to Self

> "Don’t wait for perfect. Build dirty. Iterate fast. Learn loud."

This project is part of my RedAI-Lab initiative — a personal lab to explore adversarial AI, abuse detection, and AI alignment from the field level. Not academic. Not corporate. Just real.
